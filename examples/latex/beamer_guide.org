* Introduction
This tutorial covers exporting org documents to LaTeX Beamer slides
using the new export engine, =org-elements= and =ox= (short for
org-export), written by Nicolas Goaziou.

_Note:_ It will not cover any of the basic features common with the
old beamer exporter; it will only focus on the improvements, new
additions and backwards incompatibilities.  It is also assumed that
the reader is already acquainted with GNU Emacs and Org mode itself.
Basic understanding of LaTeX and the Beamer package is also assumed.

** Initial setup
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: setup
   :END:

Unlike the old exporter, requiring the beamer exporter is not enough
to export to beamer slides with =ox=.  This difference arises from a
new feature in =ox-beamer= that allows, in the author's words, a
beamer translation of *any* org document.  This is extremely useful
when creating handouts or article versions of your slides by loading
the =beamerarticle= package (see the [[http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf][beamer user guide]] for specifics).

You can use the following minimal setup to start exporting to the
beamer =documentclass=.  As of the latest Org mode version (8.0.3),
this setup is not necessary anymore.  If you want to customise this
variable, you should do it before loading =ox-beamer=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
  (require 'ox-latex)
  (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
               '("beamer"
                 "\\documentclass\[presentation\]\{beamer\}"
                 ("\\section\{%s\}" . "\\section*\{%s\}")
                 ("\\subsection\{%s\}" . "\\subsection*\{%s\}")
                 ("\\subsubsection\{%s\}" . "\\subsubsection*\{%s\}")))
#+end_src
The first string ~beamer~ in =org-latex-classes= is by no means
unique, it can be substituted for any convenient name you wish.  This
name however should be the argument to the =LaTeX_CLASS= file header
option (or =EXPORT_LaTeX_CLASS= subtree property).

Eric recently updated the [[file:presentation.org][old example presentation]] for beamer export
to work with =ox-beamer=.  You can take a look at that to get started.

* Configuring export options
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: config
  :END:

Apart from the usual export options provided by the =OPTIONS= keyword,
you can put additional beamer export options in the file header.  For
a minimal beamer export, you have to specify the =LaTeX_CLASS= and the
=LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS= keywords in the header of a file.  A preset
export template can be inserted by calling the interactive function
=org-beamer-insert-options-template=.  This can be further modified as
per your needs.  You can also do a subtree export; in that case you
can provide the keywords as subtree =PROPERTIES=.  However take note
that the keyword names should be prepended with =EXPORT_=.  A list of
supported keywords are,

#+caption: Export option keywords and corresponding subtree properties.
| File header keywords  | Subtree properties           |
|-----------------------+------------------------------|
| =OPTIONS=             | =EXPORT_OPTIONS=             |
| =LaTeX_CLASS=         | =EXPORT_LaTeX_CLASS=         |
| =LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS= | =EXPORT_LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS= |
| =LaTeX_HEADER=        | =EXPORT_LaTeX_HEADER=        |
| =BEAMER_THEME=        | =EXPORT_BEAMER_THEME=        |
| =BEAMER_COLOR_THEME=  | =EXPORT_BEAMER_COLOR_THEME=  |
| =BEAMER_FONT_THEME=   | =EXPORT_BEAMER_FONT_THEME=   |
| =BEAMER_INNER_THEME=  | =EXPORT_BEAMER_INNER_THEME=  |
| =BEAMER_OUTER_THEME=  | =EXPORT_BEAMER_OUTER_THEME=  |
| =BEAMER_HEADER=       |                              |

For a subtree export, a few extra keywords are supported.  For example
you can specify the exported filename with the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME=
property.

#+caption: Properties specific to subtree export
| Subtree properties | Functionality    |
|--------------------+------------------|
| =EXPORT_TITLE=     | Export title     |
| =EXPORT_AUTHOR=    | Export author    |
| =EXPORT_DATE=      | Export date      |
| =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= | Export file name |

** A simple example
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: simple-example
   :END:

A simple file header might look like the example below.
#+begin_example
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS: beamer
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [presentation,smaller]
  ,#+BEAMER_THEME: default
#+end_example
A corresponding subtree export should have properties as shown below.
#+begin_example
  ,* Exported title
    :PROPERTIES:
    :EXPORT_LaTeX_CLASS: beamer
    :EXPORT_LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [presentation,smaller]
    :EXPORT_BEAMER_THEME: default
    :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: presentation.pdf
    :END:
#+end_example

The export class, as defined in =org-latex-classes=, determines the
=documentclass=, and the class options are passed on as optional
arguments (note the presence of square brackets).
: \documentclass[smaller,presentation]{beamer}

** Configuring frame export level
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: frame-level
   :END:
The new exporter allows the grouping slides into LaTeX sections.  The
sectioning behaviour is controlled by =org-latex-classes=, where as
heading levels to be exported as frames are controlled by the =H:n=
option to the =OPTIONS= keyword (=EXPORT_OPTIONS= property for subtree
export).  The ~n~ here is the headline level number that you want to
export as frames.  To elaborate with an example, to export third level
headlines as frames, use =#+OPTIONS: H:3= in the file header.  This
behaviour can be overridden per headline by setting the =BEAMER_env=
property to =frame=.  You can also provide options to a frame by
setting the =BEAMER_opt= property on the headline.  This also adds the
=fragile= option to the frame.

** Use of filters to customise export
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: export-filters
   :END:
=ox= also gives you access to all =org-element= entities in the
exported text for customisation with user filters.  Filters are
essentially simple lisp functions that reformat the exported elements.
As a simple example; the =ox-beamer= translates *bold text* as
=\alert{bold text}=.  To revert this back to the old behaviour, you
can you a filter like this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
  (defun my-beamer-bold (contents backend info)
    (when (eq backend 'beamer)
      (replace-regexp-in-string "\\`\\\\[A-Za-z0-9]+" "\\\\textbf" contents)))

  (add-to-list 'org-export-filter-bold-functions 'my-beamer-bold)
#+end_src
Another example would be to translate +strike through text+ to
=\structure{strike through text}= with the following filter.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
  (defun my-beamer-structure (contents backend info)
    (when (eq backend 'beamer)
      (replace-regexp-in-string "\\`\\\\[A-Za-z0-9]+" "\\\\structure" contents)))

  (add-to-list 'org-export-filter-strike-through-functions 'my-beamer-structure)
#+end_src

* Structure editing, environments and markup
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: editing-environments-markup
  :END:

All the usual Org mode structure editing commands work.  The minor
mode =org-beamer-mode= is also provided to make it convenient to
insert Beamer specific environments in an org-mode buffer.

A notable change in =ox-beamer= with regards to markup is, *bold text*
is translated as =\alert{bold text}= by default.

** Block environments and overlay specifications
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: environments-overlay
   :END:

All headlines below the =org-beamer-frame-level= (i.e. below =H= value
in =OPTIONS=), are exported as blocks with =ox-beamer=.  You can
choose special block environments by setting the =BEAMER_env= property
on the headline.  Supported blocks are listed in
=org-beamer-environments-default=.  To specify an overlay
specification for a frame or block environment, set the =BEAMER_act=
property.  If the value is enclosed in square brackets, it is
interpreted as a default overlay specification.
#+begin_example
  ,* A theorem block
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :BEAMER_act: <2->
    :END:

  The =BEAMER_act= property says to overlay this environment from the
  second frame onwards.
#+end_example

You can add your own environments by customising the
=org-beamer-environments-extra= variable.  For example the snippet
below adds support for =only= environment and associates to the letter
~O~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
  (add-to-list 'org-beamer-environments-extra
               '("onlyenv" "O" "\\begin{onlyenv}%a" "\\end{onlyenv}"))
#+end_src

** Special enviroments
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: special-environments
  :END:

Environments can be put in a column by setting the =BEAMER_col=
property on a headline.  It accepts decimal point numbers which is
interpreted as a fraction of the text width.  If the beadline does not
have an enviroment the headline text is ignored and all the contents
are put inside the column environment.
#+begin_example
  ,* A block in a column
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:

  ,* Just a column with contents
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:
  Some text, the headline above is ignored
#+end_example

You can start an appendix by setting the =BEAMER_env= property to
=appendix= on a headline.  Similarly you can insert notes by setting
the property to =note= (use =noteNH= to exclude the headline from the
note).  You can also use Beamer's =againframe= command by setting the
same property.  The frame being refered to by =againframe= is
specified by the =BEAMER_ref= property.  You can also ignore a
headline by using =ignoreheading=.  This can also be used to close a
=column= environment.

All contiguous environments are automatically wrapped in a =columns=
environment, although it can be forced at any point by setting the
=BEAMER_env= property to =columns=.  This might be handy if you want
to pass special options.

* New features available with the new exporter
